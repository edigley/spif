The use of an adjusted R2 (one common notation is R Â¯ 2, pronounced "R bar squared"; another is R adj 2 
    is an attempt to take account of the phenomenon of the R2 automatically and spuriously increasing when extra explanatory variables are added to the model. 
It is a modification due to Henri Theil of R2 that adjusts for the number of explanatory terms in a model relative to the number of data points.
The adjusted R2 can be negative, and its value will always be less than or equal to that of R2. 
Unlike R2, the adjusted R2 increases only when the increase in R2 (due to the inclusion of a new explanatory variable) is more than one would expect to see by chance. 
If a set of explanatory variables with a predetermined hierarchy of importance are introduced into a regression one at a time, 
    with the adjusted R2 computed each time, 
    the level at which adjusted R2 reaches a maximum, and decreases afterward, 
    would be the regression with the ideal combination of having the best fit without excess/unnecessary terms. 
The adjusted R2 is defined as...

Adjusted R2 can be interpreted as an unbiased (or less biased) estimator of the population R2, 
    whereas the observed sample R2 is a positively biased estimate of the population value.
Adjusted R2 is more appropriate when evaluating model fit (the variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables) 
    and in comparing alternative models in the feature selection stage of model building.
