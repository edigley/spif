Experiment

An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. 
Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. 
Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results.
There also exists natural experimental studies. 

Experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable. 
This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. 

Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method. 
Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. 
In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variable. 

An experiment usually tests a hypothesis. 
However, an experiment may also aim to answer a "what-if" question, without a specific expectation about what the experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results.

If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either support or disprove the hypothesis.

According to some philosophies of science, an experiment can never "prove" a hypothesis, it can only add support.

On the other hand, an experiment that provides a counterexample can disprove a theory or hypothesis, but a theory can always be salvaged by appropriate ad hoc modifications at the expense of simplicity.
