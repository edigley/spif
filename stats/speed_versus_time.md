Understanding the process described by the data in the table is aided by producing a graph or line chart of Speed versus Time.
Mathematically, if we denote time by the variable t, and speed by v, then the function plotted in the graph would be denoted 
    v(t) indicating that v (the dependent variable) is a function of t. 

Charts often include an overlaid mathematical function depicting the best-fit trend of the scattered data. 
This layer is referred to as a best-fit layer and the graph containing this layer is often referred to as a line graph. 
A true best-fit layer should depict a continuous mathematical function whose parameters are determined by using a suitable error-minimization scheme, which appropriately weights the error in the data values.

Such curve fitting functionality is often found in graphing software or spreadsheets. 
Best-fit curves may vary from simple linear equations to more complex quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and periodic curves.

A run chart, also known as a run-sequence plot is a graph that displays observed data in a time sequence.
