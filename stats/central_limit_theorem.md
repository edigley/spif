Central limit theorem

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in some situations, 
    when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a "bell curve") 
    even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. 
The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions 
can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions. 

For example, suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of observations, 
    each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, 
    and that the arithmetic mean of the observed values is computed. 
If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the distribution of the average will be closely approximated by a normal distribution. 
A simple example of this is that if one flips a coin many times the probability of getting a given number of heads in a series of flips will approach a normal curve, 
with mean equal to half the total number of flips in each series. (In the limit of an infinite number of flips, it will equal a normal curve.)
