Sample (statistics)

In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a data sample is a set of data collected and the world selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.
The elements of a sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations[citation needed].

Typically, the population is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the values in the population either impractical or impossible. 
    the sample usually represents a subset of manageable size. 
    Samples are collected and statistics are calculated from the samples, so that one can make inferences or extrapolations from the sample to the population.

The data sample may be drawn from a population 
    without replacement (i.e. no element can be selected more than once in the same sample), in which case it is a subset of a population; 
    or with replacement (i.e. an element may appear multiple times in the one sample), in which case it is a multisubset.[2]
