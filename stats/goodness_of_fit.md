Goodness of fit

Any of several measures that 
    measure how well a statistical model 
    fits observations by 
    summarizing the discrepancy between 
        observed values and 
        the values expected under the model

The goodness of fit of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of observations.
Measures of goodness of fit typically summarize the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question.

Such measures can be used in statistical hypothesis testing, e.g. 
    to test for normality of residuals, 
    to test whether two samples are drawn from identical distributions (see Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), or 
    whether outcome frequencies follow a specified distribution (see Pearson's chi-squared test). 
In the analysis of variance, one of the components into which the variance is partitioned may be a lack-of-fit sum of squares. 

Fit of distributions

In assessing whether a given distribution is suited to a data-set, the following tests and their underlying measures of fit can be used: 
    Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
    Cramér–von Mises criterion
    Anderson–Darling test
    Shapiro–Wilk test
    Chi-squared test
    Akaike information criterion
    Hosmer–Lemeshow test
    Kuiper's test
    kernelized Stein discrepancy[1]
    Zhang's ZK, ZC and ZA tests[2]
    Moran test
