Comparing models
See also: Statistical model selection

Comparing statistical models is fundamental for much of statistical inference.

The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling. 
They are typically formulated as comparisons of several statistical models. 

Models can be compared to each other via 
    exploratory data analysis or 
    confirmatory data analysis. 

In exploratory analysis, a variety of models are formulated and an assessment is performed of how well each one describes the data. 
In confirmatory analysis, previously formulated models are compared to the data.

Common criteria for comparing models include the following: 
    R2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination), 
    Bayes factor, and the 
    likelihood-ratio test together with its generalization relative likelihood.
