Dependent and independent variables

The values of dependent variables depend on the values of independent variables.

The dependent variables represent the output or outcome whose variation is being studied. 
The independent variables, also known in a statistical context as regressors, represent inputs or causes, 
    that is, potential reasons for variation. 
    
In an experiment, any variable that the experimenter manipulates can be called an independent variable. 

Models and experiments test the effects that the independent variables have on the dependent variables. 
Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other reasons, 
    such as to account for their potential confounding effect.

In an experiment, a variable, manipulated by an experimenter, is called an independent variable.
The dependent variable is the event expected to change when the independent variable is manipulated.

Modeling

In mathematical modeling, the dependent variable is studied to see if and how much it varies as the independent variables vary. 
In the simple stochastic linear model y_i = a + b*x_i + e_i the term 
    y_i is the i th value of the dependent variable and 
    x_i is the i th value of the independent variable. The term 
    e_i is known as the "error" and contains the variability of the dependent variable not explained by the independent variable.

With multiple independent variables, the model is y i = a + b x i , 1 + b x i , 2 + . . . + b x i , n + e i, where n is the number of independent variables. 

Statistics synonyms

Depending on the context, an independent variable is sometimes called a "predictor variable", regressor, covariate, "controlled variable", 
"manipulated variable", "explanatory variable", exposure variable (see reliability theory), "risk factor" (see medical statistics), 
"feature" (in machine learning and pattern recognition) or "input variable."[9][10] In econometrics, the term "control variable" is 
usually used instead of "covariate".

Depending on the context, a dependent variable is sometimes called a "response variable", "regressand", "criterion", "predicted variable", 
"measured variable", "explained variable", "experimental variable", "responding variable", "outcome variable", "output variable" or "label".

"Explanatory variable" is preferred by some authors over "independent variable" when 
    the quantities treated as independent variables may not be statistically independent or independently manipulable by the researcher.

If the independent variable is referred to as an "explanatory variable" then the term "response variable" is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.

"Explained variable" is preferred by some authors over "dependent variable" when the quantities treated as "dependent variables" may not be statistically dependent.[18] If the dependent variable is referred to as an "explained variable" then the term "predictor variable" is preferred by some authors for the independent variable.[18]

Variables may also be referred to by their form: continuous, binary/dichotomous, nominal categorical, and ordinal categorical, among others.
