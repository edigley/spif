Statistical population

In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment.[1] A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker).[2] A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.[3]

In statistical inference, a subset of the population (a statistical sample) is chosen to represent the population in a statistical analysis.[4] The ratio of the size of this statistical sample to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction. It is then possible to estimate the population parameters using the appropriate sample statistics. 

Subpopulation

A subconcept of a population that shares one or more additional properties is called a subpopulation. 
For example, if the population is all Egyptian people, a subpopulation is all Egyptian males; 
    if the population is all pharmacies in the world, a subpopulation is all pharmacies in Egypt. 
By contrast, a sample is a subset of a population that is not chosen to share any additional property.

Descriptive statistics may yield different results for different subpopulations. 
For instance, a particular medicine may have different effects on different subpopulations, 
    and these effects may be obscured or dismissed if such special subpopulations are not identified and examined in isolation. 

Similarly, one can often estimate parameters more accurately if one separates out subpopulations: 
    the distribution of heights among people is better modeled by considering men and women as separate subpopulations, for instance.
