Standard deviation

Standard deviation: SD, also represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s.

The standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, 
    while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values. 

The standard deviation is the square root of its variance. 
    It may come from a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution 

A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data. 

In addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions.

For example, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. 
This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the "standard error" of the estimate or "standard error of the mean" when referring to a mean.
It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed. 

In science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations 
    away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant—normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this 
    way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations. 

The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment. 

When only a sample of data from a population is available, the term 
    standard deviation of the sample or sample standard deviation can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to 
    a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (the standard deviation of the entire population). 

Interpretation and application

A large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean. 

The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean). 

For example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. 
Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. 
The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7. 
It will have the same units as the data points themselves. 
If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. 

As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. 
It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters. 

Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty.
In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements gives the precision of those measurements.

While the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. 
An example is the mean absolute deviation, which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the root mean square distance inherent in the standard deviation.
