Confounding

In statistics, a confounder (also confounding variable, confounding factor, or lurking variable) is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association. 
Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations.

Control

Consider a researcher attempting to assess the effectiveness of drug X, from population data in which drug usage was a patient's choice.
The data shows that gender (Z) differences influence a patient's choice of drug as well as their chances of recovery (Y).
In this scenario, gender Z confounds the relation between X and Y since Z is a cause of both X and Y.

An experiment must also control the possible confounding factorsâ€”any factors that would affect the accuracy or repeatability of the experiment or the ability to interpret the results. 
Confounding is commonly eliminated through scientific controls and/or, in randomized experiments, through random assignment. 

In engineering and the physical sciences, experiments are a primary component of the scientific method.
