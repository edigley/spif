Statistical model

A statistical model is a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data 
    (and similar data from a larger population). A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.

A statistical model is usually specified as a mathematical relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables. 
As such, a statistical model is "a formal representation of a theory"

All statistical hypothesis tests and all statistical estimators are derived via statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference.

Mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and variables.
Relationships can be described by operators, such as algebraic operators, functions, differential operators, etc.
Variables are abstractions of system parameters of interest, that can be quantified.

Several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure:

    Linear vs. nonlinear: If all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit linearity, the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear.
        A model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise.
