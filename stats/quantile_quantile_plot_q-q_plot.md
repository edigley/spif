The Q-Q plot, or quantile-quantile plot, is a graphical tool to help us assess if a set of data plausibly came from some theoretical distribution such as a Normal or exponential.

Normal quantile plots are a way of looking at a data set to see if it seems plausible that it may be a sample from a normally distributed population or procedure. 
The basic idea of the normal quantile plot is to compare the data values with the values one would predict for a standard normal distribution.



Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model.

This can provide an assessment of "goodness of fit" that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary. 
Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other.[4] 
Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, 
    or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal. 

The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions.

A Q–Q plot is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other, or a plot based on estimates of the quantiles. 
The pattern of points in the plot is used to compare the two distributions. 

The main step in constructing a Q–Q plot is calculating or estimating the quantiles to be plotted.

(the inverse function of the CDF is the quantile function)

Interpretation

The points plotted in a Q–Q plot are always non-decreasing when viewed from left to right.
If the two distributions being compared are identical, the Q–Q plot follows the 45° line y = x.
If the two distributions agree after linearly transforming the values in one of the distributions, then the Q–Q plot follows some line, but not necessarily the line y = x.

If the general trend of the Q–Q plot is flatter than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the vertical axis.
Conversely, if the general trend of the Q–Q plot is steeper than the line y = x, the distribution plotted on the vertical axis is more dispersed than the distribution plotted on the horizontal axis.

Q–Q plots are often arced, or "S" shaped, indicating that one of the distributions is more skewed than the other, or that one of the distributions has heavier tails than the other.
