Correlation does not imply causation

In statistics, many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated, 
    it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other.

That "correlation proves causation" is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. 
This fallacy is also known as 
    cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for "with this, therefore because of this", and "false cause". 
A similar fallacy, that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is the 
    post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for "after this, therefore because of this.") fallacy. 

For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking 
    combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), 
    leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. 
But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD. 
Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), 
with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens. 
The use of HRT and decreased incidence of coronary heart disease were coincident effects of a common cause 
    (i.e. the benefits associated with a higher socioeconomic status), rather than a direct cause and effect, as had been supposed.

As with any logical fallacy, identifying that the reasoning behind an argument is flawed does not imply that the resulting conclusion is false. 

In the instance above, if the trials had found that hormone replacement therapy does in fact have a negative incidence on the 
    likelihood of coronary heart disease the assumption of causality would have been correct, 
    although the logic behind the assumption would still have been flawed.

Indeed, a few go further, using correlation as a basis for testing a hypothesis to try to establish a true causal relationship; 
examples are the Granger causality test, convergent cross mapping, and Liang-Kleeman information flow


Usage

In logic, the technical use of the word "implies" means "is a sufficient circumstance for".
This is the meaning intended by statisticians when they say causation is not certain.
Indeed, p implies q has the technical meaning of the material conditional: 
    "if p then q" symbolized as "p -> q". 
That is "if circumstance p is true, then q follows." 
In this sense, it is always correct to say "Correlation does not imply causation." 

However, in casual use, the word "implies" loosely means suggests rather than requires. Where there is causation, there is a likely correlation. 
Indeed, correlation is often used when inferring causation; the important point is that correlation is not sufficient. 

General pattern

For any two correlated events, A and B, the different possible relationships include:

    A causes B (direct causation);
    B causes A (reverse causation);
    A and B are consequences of a common cause, but do not cause each other;
    A and B both cause C, which is (explicitly or implicitly) conditioned on;
    A causes B and B causes A (bidirectional or cyclic causation);
    A causes C which causes B (indirect causation);
    There is no connection between A and B; the correlation is a coincidence.

Thus there can be no conclusion made regarding the existence or the direction of a cause-and-effect relationship only from the fact that A and B are correlated.
Determining whether there is an actual cause-and-effect relationship requires further investigation, 
    even when the relationship between A and B is statistically significant, 
    a large effect size is observed, or a large part of the variance is explained. 

Causality

    Causality (also referred to as causation, or cause and effect) is what connects one process, the cause, with another process or state, the effect, 
    where the cause is necessary for the effect to take place; the former is hence said to be a cause of the latter.    

In general, a process has many causes, which are also said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past. 
An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. 
Multiple philosophers have believed that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space.

Causality is an abstraction that indicates how the world progresses,[citation needed] so basic a concept that it is more apt as an explanation of other concepts of progression than as something to be explained by others more basic. The concept is like those of agency and efficacy. For this reason, a leap of intuition may be needed to grasp it.[6] Accordingly, causality is implicit in the logic and structure of ordinary language.
