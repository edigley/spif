Scatter plot

A scatter plot (also called a scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram)[3] 
    is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.

If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed.

A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval.

Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated).

If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. 
If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation.

A line of best fit (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn in order to study the relationship between the variables.
An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures.
For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as linear regression and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time.

No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary relationships.


The word derives from the Medieval Latin verb "confudere", which meant "mixing", and was probably chosen to represent the confusion (from Latin: con=with + fusus=mix or fuse together)

In the case of risk assessments evaluating the magnitude and nature of risk to human health, 
    it is important to control for confounding to isolate the effect of a particular hazard such as a food additive, pesticide, or new drug. 
For prospective studies, it is difficult to recruit and screen for volunteers with the same background (age, diet, education, geography, etc.), 
and in historical studies, there can be similar variability. 

Due to the inability to control for variability of volunteers and human studies, confounding is a particular challenge. 
For these reasons, experiments offer a way to avoid most forms of confounding.
