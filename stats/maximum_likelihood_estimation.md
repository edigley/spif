Maximum likelihood estimation

In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model, given observations. 
The method obtains the parameter estimates by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function. 
The estimates are called maximum likelihood estimates, which is also abbreviated as MLE.

The method of maximum likelihood is used with a wide range of statistical analyses. 
As an example, suppose that we are interested in the heights of adult female penguins, 
    but are unable to measure the height of every penguin in a population (due to cost or time constraints). 
Assuming that the heights are normally distributed with some unknown mean and variance, 
    the mean and variance can be estimated with MLE while only knowing the heights of some sample of the overall population. 
MLE would accomplish that by taking the mean and variance as parameters and finding particular parametric values 
    that make the observed results the most probable given the normal model. 

Likelihood function

    In statistics, a likelihood function (often simply the likelihood) is a particular function of the parameter of a statistical model given data. 
    Likelihood functions play a key role in statistical inference.

    In informal contexts, "likelihood" is often used as a synonym for "probability". 
    In statistics, the two terms have different meanings. 
    Probability is used before data are available to describe plausibility of a future outcome, given a value for the parameter. 
    Likelihood is used after data are available to describe plausibility of a parameter value.

Likelihood is used with each of the four main foundations of statistics: 
    frequentism, 
    Bayesianism, 
    likelihoodism, and 
    AIC-based. 
The case for using likelihood in the foundation of statistics was first made by the founder of modern statistics, R. A. Fisher; a relevant quotation is below. 

    What has now appeared is that the mathematical concept of probability is ... inadequate to express our mental confidence or [lack of confidence] in making ... 
        inferences, and that the mathematical quantity which usually appears to be appropriate for measuring our order of preference 
        among different possible populations does not in fact obey the laws of probability. 
        To distinguish it from probability, I have used the term "likelihood" to designate this quantity....
