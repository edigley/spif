Random Variable

Random variable: random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable

A random variable is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon.

More specifically, a random variable is defined as a function that maps the outcomes of an unpredictable process to numerical quantities, typically real numbers.

It is a variable (specifically a dependent variable), in the sense that it depends on the outcome of an underlying process providing the input to this function, 
    and it is random in the sense that the underlying process is assumed to be random.

The domain of a random variable is the set of possible outcomes. 
In the case of the coin, there are only two possible outcomes, namely heads or tails. 
Since one of these outcomes must occur, either the event that the coin lands heads or the event that the coin lands tails must have non-zero probability. 

A random variable has a probability distribution, which specifies the probability of its values. 
Random variables can be discrete, that is, taking any of a specified finite or countable list of values, endowed with a probability mass function characteristic of the random variable's probability distribution; 
or continuous, taking any numerical value in an interval or collection of intervals, via a probability density function that is characteristic of the random variable's probability distribution; or a mixture of both types. 

Two random variables with the same probability distribution can still differ in terms of their associations with, or independence from, other random variables. 
The realizations of a random variable are called random variates. 
That is, the results of randomly choosing values according to the variable's probability distribution function.

The formal mathematical treatment of random variables is a topic in probability theory. 
In that context, a random variable is understood as a function defined on a sample space whose outcomes are numerical values.
