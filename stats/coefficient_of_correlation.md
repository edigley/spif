Correlation coefficient

A correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of some type of correlation, meaning a statistical relationship between two variables.

The variables may be 
    two columns of a given data set of observations, often called a sample, 
    or two components of a multivariate random variable with a known distribution.

Several types of correlation coefficient exist, each with their own definition and own range of usability and characteristics. 
They all assume values in the range from −1 to +1, where ±1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and 0 the strongest possible disagreement.

As tools of analysis, correlation coefficients present certain problems, including 
    the propensity of some types to be distorted by outliers and 
    the possibility of incorrectly being used to infer a causal relationship between the variables.

Pearson

The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, also known as r, R, or Pearson's r, is a measure of 
    the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables that is defined as 
        the covariance of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. 
This is the best known and most commonly used type of correlation coefficient; 
    when the term "correlation coefficient" is used without further qualification, it usually refers to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
