Regression analysis

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, 
    when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors').

More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') 
    changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. 

In statistics, the term linear model is used in different ways according to the context. 
The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model.
In each case, the designation "linear" is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible.
