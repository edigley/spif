Two Stage Data-Driven Framework for Fire Spread Prediction

Scenarios to be considered:

1. Use the central point of the map as ignition point
2. Use the same map resolution in all scenarios
3. Use the entire wind direction search space
4. Define the wind velocity range
5. Define the prediction period [8 horas, 30 horas]
