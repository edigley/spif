Fitting a basic MARS model

We can fit a MARS model with the earth package. 
By default, earth::earth() will assess all potential knots across all supplied features 
    and then will prune to the optimal number of knots based on an expected change in R^2 (for the training data) of less than 0.001. 
This calculation is performed by the Generalized cross-validation procedure (GCV statistic), 
which is a computational shortcut for linear models that produces an error value that approximates leave-one-out cross-validation (see here for technical details).

Partial dependence plots with two target features enable us to visualize interactions among them. 
The two-way partial dependence plot shows the dependence of median house price on joint values of house age and avg. occupants per household. 
We can clearly see an interaction between the two features: 
For an avg. occupancy greater than two, the house price is nearly independent of the house age, whereas for values less than two there is a strong dependence on age.
